<strong>College Panhellenic Council</strong><br/><br/>
The CPC is the programming and 
governing body of the five National Panhellenic Conference sororities,
one National Latina sorority and one local sorority at RIT.
Every woman who joins one of these organizations becomes a member 
of the College Panhellenic Council. The council consists of a delegate 
from each chapter and 6 executive officers. The council meets weekly 
to strengthen ties of communication between the chapters. The group has 
received recognition at the local level for excellence in community service, 
scholastic achievement, and public relations.
<br/><br/>
Throughout the year, the Panhellenic Council provides opportunities 
for interaction among all members to strengthen Greek sisterhood by 
sponsoring many activities including recruitment, philanthropic and 
community service projects, speakers, faculty appreciation days, 
award recognition dinners, Greek Weekend, Greek Carnival and much more.
