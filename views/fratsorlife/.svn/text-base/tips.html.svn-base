<strong>Thinking about joining a Fraternity or Sorority? </strong><br/><br/>
<i>Tips for a Successful Recruitment Experience</i><br/>



<ol>
   <li>During recruitment, ask lots of questions. Remember, there are no foolish questions.
   </li><br/>
   <li>Clearly understand the obligations of being a member, especially the financial obligation.
   </li><br/>
   <li>If the chapter has a house, clearly understand what your commitment to live-in will be as a member.
   </li><br/>
   <li>Alcohol is NOT permitted at any recruitment activity. Play by the rules.
   </li><br/>
   <li>The decision to join a fraternity/sorority is a life-long commitment. Be clear what you expect and what you are prepared to give to this commitment.
   </li><br/>
   <li>Understand the academic support programs of the chapter. Every chapter should have a scholarship program. Learn about it. You will need more support to achieve your academic potential.
   </li><br/>
   <li>Understand the total costs, beyond dues and room/board of membership.
   </li><br/>
   <li>Examine the new member program. Find out how many weeks the education process is and what is expected of you during this time.
   </li><br/>
   <li>E-mail the Faculty Advisor to ask questions about the chapter.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Discuss the community service program of the chapter.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Understand the educational programs the chapter sponsors and participates in on campus.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Review the Chapter's Strategic or Annual Plan.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Familiarize yourself with chapter names and the Greek alphabet; it will make the recruitment process much easier for you.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Remember that affiliation in a fraternity/sorority takes commitment, effort, money and time.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Be yourself!
	</li><br/>
	<li>Ignore belittling and derogatory remarks you may hear about "Going Greek." You will need to find out if this is right for you.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Take advantage of the Recruitment Kick-off Events and Open Houses.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Seek to affiliate with a chapter which you feel you can benefit from and which you can contribute your time, energy and talents for a lifetime.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Your decision as to which chapter to join is "your" decision; don't be pressured by anyone else.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Have fun; enjoy the experience!
	</li><br/>
