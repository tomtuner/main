According to Mr. Alfred L. Davis, Vice President Emeritus of RIT, as the school grew in enrollment, RIT\'s Board of Trustees felt that the Institute should expand and relocate. On the night of November 21, 1961, the Board voted to build a new campus in Henrietta. That same night, as soon as student leaders heard the exciting news, the Student Association (predecessor to Student Government) voted to donate $10,000 towards construction of the new campus. This donation was very significant because it came from the student body.<br /><br /> When it was time for the Board of Trustees to select a name for the new \"Union\", they gave considerable thought to an appropriate name. They wanted a name to reflect the philosophy that this building should be available for the benefit of every member of the RIT community- students, faculty, staff, alumni, and visitors alike. Second, they wished to recognize the outstanding financial contributions of RIT\'s alumni towards the Union. The name reflected the strong connection between the current RIT population and its alumni. Thus was born the name \"College Alumni Union.\" Students recently lobbied to change the name so that it may better represent the fact that students need a place dedicated for students. The Student Alumni Union name was adopted.<br /><br /> Today the SAU is a living and learning laboratory, whose services and programs promote student interaction, experiential education, and self-governance in partnership with RIT faculty and staff. <strong><a href=\"sau/hours\"><br /> <br /> <br /></a></strong><img src=\"images/link.gif\" alt=\"click link\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\" />&nbsp;

These Greek organizations offer students an opportunity to enhance college life in a unique environment. Commitment to personal and organizational excellence is the cornerstone for a RIT Greek experience. Greek membership is a valuable opportunity for personal, intellectual and social development.<br /><br />Each fraternity and sorority shares a deep commitment toward development of the individual members as well as the entire chapter. Throughout the past year, RIT Greek have promoted scholarship, actively participated in a variety of community service projects, raised money for their national philanthropies, competed in athletic and intramural sports and socialized with other organizations.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /> ','2011-06-08 15:10:16','cclwww','fratsorlife','index','Fraternity & Sorority Life'),(25,0,'<p>The support our clubs and organizations receive from the faculty and staff members across RIT who agree to serve as advisors is invaluable.

Hopefully these responses will begin to clarify some of those perceptions and, at the same time, provide you with the answers to some of the questions most commonly asked by parents.<br /> <br />  <p><strong>Won&rsquo;t a fraternity or sorority have an adverse effect on my student&rsquo;s grades?<br />   </strong><br /> Actually, it&rsquo;s more likely that a fraternity or sorority will help your student&rsquo;s grades. When a student joins a fraternity or sorority, he or she becomes a part of a larger group of students who have already made it through their first year at RIT. Not only does the group understand what a first-year student is facing, but they can also provide assistance in most of the courses your student will be taking. There are few other places where a student can gain access to the variety of resources that the Greek community can provide. Ultimately, the responsibility for succeeding in the classroom is the individual student&rsquo;s. With the broad range of resources available within the Greek community, however, students are more likely to achieve their academic potential.<br /> <br />  </p> 		   		<p><strong>Are Greeks really like the actors in ANIMAL HOUSE? <br /> </strong><br /> Many people have the misconception that the image of Greek organizations depicted in Animal House is really what is happening on college campuses across America. In reality, the Animal House image of Greek Life could not be further from the truth. The RIT Greek community focuses on responsibility in our activities. The university promotes alcohol responsibility in a number of ways; including sponsoring a national educational organization called Greeks Advocating the Mature Management of Alcohol (GAMMA) as well as many national risk management speakers. Although an individual&rsquo;s actions are entirely up to him/her, Greeks hold their members accountable for their actions and use their founding principals as guides in their activities.<br /> <br />  </p> 		   		<p><strong>What does being Greek really mean?<br />  </strong><br /> Membership in a Greek letter organization is a lifetime obligation. Choosing the Greek community means working with a group of men or women who can exchange and stand for common goals and ideas while being held to a higher standard than other college students. The Greek experience during the college years is a gateway to many rewards and connections later in life. Each chapter develops a special bond called brotherhood and sisterhood. Both are nurtured thorough common work, laughter, service projects, intramurals and the shared success and frustrations of all. Throughout the student&rsquo;s life, membership will be an unwritten bond of friendship no matter what course his/her life takes.<br /> <br />  </p> 		   		<p><strong>Does it cost a lot to be Greek?<br />  </strong><br /> Joining a fraternity or sorority does carry a financial commitment. Each chapter is self-supporting through dues paid by their members. When students join a Greek letter organization, they also agree to pay dues and fees while in school to maintain membership. Although chapters may make accommodations for special needs, students should discuss the financial obligations with their parent(s) before deciding to join. Each chapter has different dues for membership that cover such things as chapter and national dues, due to the Interfraternity, Panhellenic, and National Pan-Hellenic Councils, social activities, resources and other miscellaneous costs.<br /> <br />  </p> 		   		<p><strong>What about hazing and alcohol abuse?<br /> </strong> <br /> Hazing is a big concern to parents. RIT and New York State Law prohibit hazing of any kind. New members experience a period of orientation. During this time, your child will attend a new member retreat to learn about hazing, leadership retreats, community service projects, and activities designed to build friendships among the new members and the older members. Each new member is asked to sign an anti-hazing statement stating that they will not allow themselves to be hazed and will report any such wrongdoing. Hazing will not be tolerated! </p> 		   		<p>Alcohol abuse is unhealthy and inconsistent with fraternity and sorority ideals. All fraternities and sororities are expected to uphold state, county, city laws, and university policies regarding the consumption of alcohol. In addition, chapters are not allowed to purchase alcohol for their members due to national risk-management policies. The Interfraternity, Panhellenic, and National Pan-Hellenic councils will also take proper actions against the chapter if alcohol is being abused.&nbsp;</p> 		   		<p><strong>Won&rsquo;t working while in school conflict with participation in a fraternity or sorority?</strong></p><p><br /> Actually, many students involved in the RIT Greek community are also employed outside of the classroom. In today&rsquo;s world, the reality is that only the lucky few can afford to attend college without outside employment. Fraternities and sororities recognize that it is important for members to be able to meet their financial obligations and that many students will work to help finance their educations. Working students can still take advantage of the opportunities available through the Greek community.<br /> <br />  </p> 		   		<p><strong>Who is actually in charge of the fraternity or sorority?<br /> </strong><br /> Fraternity and sorority members elected to officer positions manage the day-to-day operations of the organization. These officers are assisted by members serving on committees and by alumni who act as advisors. In addition, most Greek organizations at RIT are part of a national organization which offers support, advice, and direction through a paid professional staff and regional volunteers. Professional staff from the university are employed to assist and monitor the activities of Greek organizations. As you can see a variety of individuals oversee the operations of the fraternity.<br /> <br />  </p> 		   		<p><strong>What is my role as a parent?<br /> </strong><br /> Be supportive and learn as much as you can by asking questions of your son or daughter as he/she meets people through the recruitment/intake process. Also be an active parent during your child&rsquo;s years in a fraternity or sorority. Remember, being in a fraternity or sorority can only benefit your child. Encourage and support your child. Greek members will be more than happy to tell him or her (and you) about their group. If you ever have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the Greek Advisor.</p>','2007-07-09 15:02:23','1','fratsorlife','parents','Resources | For Parents'),(50,0,'<p>&nbsp;<strong>The Club Center serves a variety of purposes</strong><br /><br />At the Club Center you can:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pick up petty cash and checks</li>\r\n<li>Hand in Expense Approval Forms (EAF)</li>\r\n<li>Make appointments with club financial staff</li>\r\n<li>Make deposits</li>\r\n<li>Drop off receipts and VISA cards</li>\r\n<li>Hand in annual Club Budgets</li>\r\n<li>Get a club statement printout and account balance</li>\r\n<li>Find out if your club is frozen and why</li>\r\n<li>Pick up blank club forms including EAFs, AFAFs, W-9 forms, tax exempt forms, mileage forms, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Find out about important club dates</li>\r\n<li>Get information about Finance Certification</li>\r\n<li>Check your Club Mailbox!</li>\r\n<li>Meet with the Club Center Staff about paperwork and events</li>\r\n<li>Get your t-shirt design approved by Sarah</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<table width=\"349\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"left\" width=\"100\">Location:<br /><br /></td>\r\n<td>Campus Center 1st Floor<br /><br /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"left\">Phone:<br /><br /></td>\r\n<td>585.475.4111<br /><br /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"left\">E.Mail:<br /><br /></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"mailto:infosg@rit.edu\">infosg@rit.edu<br /></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Regular Hours:<br /><br /></td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Monday- Thursday: 10 a.m. -7 p.m.<br />Friday: 10 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Summer Hours:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday-Friday 10 a.m. - 4:30p.m.</p>\r\n<p><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>','2012-07-16 13:55:51','sbgccl','clubs','sginfo','Resources | Club Center'),(62,0,'<strong>Leadership<br /> </strong><br /> The Greek community is dedicated to building future societal leaders by providing a wealth of leadership opportunities for Greek members. From social issues to academic, business to philanthropy, the leaders of today are gaining their leadership edge from their fraternity and sorority experiences. <p> Membership in a fraternal or sororal organization is one of the most outstanding means of discovering and refining your leadership potential. Within each chapter, members have the chance to assume a wide spectrum of leadership roles. These roles may range from serving as rush chair to treasurer, social chair to president. Within each fraternity exists anywhere from five to twenty different leadership positions, all requiring different degrees of skills and investments. Opportunities to learn and practice leadership stretch beyond chapters. </p>  		 <p> There are many system-wide leadership roles open on the Greek Council, IFC, NPC and the NPHC. Beyond the Greek community, fraternity men and sorority women are involved in many other organizations on campus. Some of these include Student Government, athletic teams, and many student clubs.<br /> <br />  </p>  		 		 <p> 		<strong>Philanthropy and Community Service<br /> </strong><br /> Philanthropy projects are events in which the Greek communities as a whole, or as individual chapters, donate their time and efforts to raise funds to benefit some worthwhile cause. </p>  		 <p> Chapters on campus plan many philanthropy and community service projects during the year to benefit a variety of agencies. One of the big philanthropy projects that the Greek community does every quarter is &quot;Adopt a Highway&quot; on East River Road. </p>  		 <p> Most chapters require members to maintain community service hours; yet these requirements are not a burden due to the satisfaction one gets when they have been completed. Philanthropy projects and community service are more than just helping out a cause. They show the community what Greeks are really like and they are a lot of fun for everybody involved.<br /> <br />  </p>  		 		 <p> 		<strong>Scholarship<br /> </strong><br /> Academic achievement is the first and foremost priority of all University students. Scholastic achievement is also central to the mission of most fraternities and sororities. Each fraternity or sorority places strong emphasis on creating an atmosphere conducive to high academic performance, as well as challenging each individual to live up to his and her highest academic potential. </p>  		 <p> Each fraternity and sorority generally implements various programs designed to assist members in their academic pursuits. Programs range from tutoring, help with scheduling, quiet study areas in the house, study tables for new members, test files, and awards for good grades. </p>  		 <p> Additionally, most organizations provide some financial scholarships supported by their national organizations and local alumni groups. These efforts reinforce the belief that academic achievement is an integral part of the fraternity and sorority experience.<br /> <br />  </p>  		 		 <p> 		<strong>Alumni Networking<br /> </strong><br /> Greek membership is for a lifetime. One of the greatest benefits that comes with being a member of the Greek community are the relationships you make with alumni, which provide many opportunities for career networking and mentoring, not only with your initial job search but also throughout your career. Homecoming, chapter anniversary dinners, conferences, conventions, and other events foster interaction with alumni. Alumni/graduate chapters located throughout the nation provide opportunities for continued involvement after graduation. Because their Greek experience was so meaningful, many alumni &ldquo;give back&rdquo; to their organization by volunteering their time on a chapter advisory board, housing corporations&rsquo; board, or as a regional or district officer.<br /> <br />  </p>  		 		 <p> 		<strong>Brotherhood/Sisterhood<br /> </strong><br /> Throughout your college experience at RIT, the friendships that our members make within their chapters are the ones that last a lifetime. Whether you came to college not knowing a single person or knowing several people, the opportunity to be a part of a brotherhood or sisterhood transcends your RIT college experience. </p>  		 <p> Brotherhood and sisterhood are the bonds of unity and friendship that last a lifetime. These bonds are not only among members for each individual chapter, but amongst chapters around the nation, due to the history and the ideals that each chapter was founded upon. </p>  		 <p> By becoming a member of the Greek community, you will meet people who will grow to become your closest friends; those who will cheer you on when you&rsquo;re successful and who will support you when the going gets tough. Lifelong friendships and associations are made through active participation in a Greek organization. </p>  		 <p> These relationships are deeper than going to parties, more meaningful than wearing the same letters. They are about growth and development of individuals as they begin their lives at RIT. Each new member brings his or her unique talents to the fraternity or sorority and is valued and respected for the way he or she is.<br /> <br />  </p>  		 		 <p> 		<strong>Social and Recreational Involvement<br /> </strong><br /> While academics are the main reason for one to attend RIT, you will achieve the best college experience possible through the proper balancing of academics and social activities. Joining a fraternity or sorority will offer you the most extensive social outlets possible on the RIT campus. Being Greek gives you the opportunity to meet new friends through participation in events like Brick City Festival, Alumni Weekends, Date Nights, Formals, Theme Parties, Greek Weekend and many other social activities. Fraternity men and sorority women pride themselves on the ability to help their fellow brothers and sisters develop socially and learn to have fun in a safe environment. </p>','2007-07-09 15:00:33','1','fratsorlife','benefits','Resources | Benefits of Greek Life'),(57,0,'<p><strong>How to form a Student Government Recognized Club</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"large_size\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12pt;\">If your group already has an advisor, please proceed to step 5.&nbsp; If not, start at step 1.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Fill out an <strong><a title=\"App: Intent to Form\" href=\"clubs/resources\">Intent to Form Application</a></strong>, which can also&nbsp; be found in the Center for Campus Life (CCL) office, located on the 2nd floor of the SAU RITreat.

At the same time, you, the potential new member decides which chapter interests you the most. The recruitment process is a great opportunity to meet active members, to hear their activities, values, and ideals. However, participation in recruitment does not obligate you to join.<br /><br />    <p> <strong>How Do I Decide?<br /> </strong><br /> Each person looks for different aspects in a particular fraternity/sorority. While all chapters place emphasis on academics, some chapters are also known for a focus on athletics, community service, or friendship. Most chapters encourage a well-rounded approach. The choice is up to you. Look at all the chapters and evaluate which best meets your needs and interest.<br /><br /> </p>   <p> <strong>How Should I Act During Recruitment?</strong><br />   <br />Rule number one is to be yourself. You want to know what the chapter is like and they want to know the real you. Therefore, be yourself and do not put up a &quot;front.&quot;<br /><br /> </p>   <p> <strong>Before I Join, What Do I Need To Know?</strong><br />   <br />Joining a fraternity/sorority carries certain responsibilities. Make sure you know the entire financial obligation that is required. Costs will vary from chapter to chapter, but expenses will generally include quarterly, local and national dues as well as one time new member and initiation fees. Furthermore, you should understand all the aspects of membership that are required for initiation into the chapter. Do not hesitate to ask questions. Active members will be more than willing to help you out.<br /><br /> </p>   <p><strong>What Happens When I Become A New Member?</strong><br />   <br /> A potential new member becomes a new member when he/she accepts a bid to become a member. As a new member you will partake in an education period during which you are prepared for active membership. The length of the new member period varies. During this time you are involved in a variety of activities, all designed to enable the new members to become a part of the brotherhood/sisterhood. Such activities include becoming acquainted with your chapter&#39;s history, its goals, how it functions, and your key to its future. As each new member brings new life into the chapter, each chapter will bring something new into the life of each of you who join. Once you become an initiated member of a national fraternity and sorority, you are ineligible for membership in any other fraternity/sorority. Being a new member is a time to learn about college, your chapter, and especially yourself. However, requiring new member to engage in any type of prank or hazing activity is prohibited. If you feel you have been subject to such behavior, contact the Office of Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life at 585-475-7123.</p>','2008-09-16 12:37:25','1','fratsorlife','recruitment','Resources | Recruitment'),(61,0,'<p><strong>Why vend at RIT?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Vending at RIT is a great opportunity to sell products and services to potentially thousands of students, faculty and staff members.</p>\r\n<p>Assistance from a student organization is available during your visit to RIT.
